There is a video series that details how to use Ansible for Cisco IOS devices that can be found at my website here

To use Ansible on Juniper devices you need to enable the netconf service on you Juniper device with this command.

# set system services netconf ssh

Also I recommend you upgrade to Ansible 2.3 to resolve any issues or bugs you might run into.
